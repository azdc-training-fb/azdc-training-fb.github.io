Landing page for azdc-training organization - have fun! 🚀

This is a sample README.md where you document your newly created Coding Dreams! 🧚‍♀️ 🧚‍♂️

And if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:

```javascript
if (!isAwesome) {
  return true
}
```

🦸‍♀️ 🦸‍♂️

But I have to admit, tasks lists are my favorite:

- [ ] This is an incomplete item

Don't forget to add images 🤷‍♀️:
